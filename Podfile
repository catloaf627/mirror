# --- Why this block is needed ---
# Some older pods (like Masonry) still declare an ancient deployment target (e.g. iOS 8).
# Xcode 15+ no longer supports that and errors with:
# "SDK does not contain 'libarclite' ... try increasing the minimum deployment target."
#
# This post_install block force-updates every Pod target to use iOS 12.0 (or newer).
# Without this, Masonry will still try to build for iOS 8 and fail.
